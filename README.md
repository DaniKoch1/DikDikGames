# DikDikGames
This repository contains an educational game thats purpose is to give an insight into how circuits work. First the user is guided through a number of steps in order to create the circuit. The steps not only instruct what to do, but also explain why and what is happening inside the circuit. The final product is used as input for premade games. 

The input is created on an arduino board and programmed in it's language, while the game is created in the Unity Framework and involves C# scripts.

The premade games are:  
  -a dancing game (arrows on the ground)  
  -pinball (with the use of the distance meter, buttons and a diod)
